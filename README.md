PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is my first dynamic website that I built for my first year assignment in computer science where I received 96% for it. The entire code have been added to this repository.

The goal of the webiste was for me to imporve my skills in HTML5 and CSS3. It was also my first time learning how bootstrap works and using it in an actual project. PHP scrips were used in this project that was used as a back end programming language. I connected to a database that populates the Camp sites.

The website allows the users to search for Camp sites and get information regarding it. If the user is logged in, the user is able to contatct the ownder and do bookings.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.

P.S - The main aim of this project is to learn PHP and test my knowledge. Therfore, not that much effort was put into the UI aspect. This is something that I plan to go back to and imporve.
